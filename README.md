# üè• NHS A&E Data Pipeline & Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project builds a modular data engineering pipeline to extract, transform, and load publicly available NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) datasets into a SQL database. The goal is to surface meaningful operational insights through interactive visualisations using Streamlit ‚Äî helping NHS analysts, clinicians, and managers make data-driven decisions.

---

## Plan

For this project, I chose to analyse A&E data from the National Health Service. After reviewing my selected dataset, I identified analytical questions that could yield valuable insights into the performance of A&E departments across the country. This process effectively guided the direction of my project.

Following this, I established a Kanban board within GitHub Projects and began defining user stories to outline the necessary steps for delivering the solution. I then utilised Jupyter Notebooks to conduct exploratory data analysis, which enhanced my understanding of what I could present in my application.

The project is centred around an end-to-end ETL pipeline, which I will discuss further below. Once my cleaned data was successfully loaded into my SQL database, I experimented with Streamlit to present my insights in a visually interactive manner.

### Improvements

I wanted to include this section here as I have reflected on my project and realised that there are many aspects I would approach differently. One significant area where I fell short was in testing. Unfortunately, I prioritised other tasks and ultimately ran out of time. In the future, I recognise the importance of adhering to best practices and will incorporate test-driven development into my work.

## Data Journey: ETL Pipeline

### üîπ Extract
- Raw CSVs downloaded from [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/)
- Monthly trust-level data on attendances, breaches, 12-hour waits, and emergency admissions

### üîπ Transform
- Cleaned and filtered using pandas
- Removed rows with zero attendances or missing coordinates
- Converted `period` to datetime format
- Enriched with latitude/longitude for geospatial mapping
- Aggregated breach metrics and standardised trust codes

### üîπ Load
- Loaded into a PostgreSQL database (Pagila schema)
- Queried via modular SQL scripts for performance and maintainability

### üîπ Visualize
- Streamlit dashboard with multi-page layout:
  - National trends
  - Trust-level breach analysis
  - Geospatial pressure hotspots

---

## Dashboard Features

### Home Page
- National % seen within 4 hours over time
- Top 5 trusts with the highest 12-hour waits
- Metric cards and line charts for quick insights

### Operational Pressure
- KPI breakdowns by present month (July 2025)
- Breach rate analysis and emergency admission trends

### Geospatial Mapping
- Interactive map showing trust-level pressure hotspots
- Sized and colored by 12-hour waits
- Hover reveals the trust name and attendance volume

---

## Key Questions & Insights

- How has A&E performance changed over the last five years?
- Which trusts are under the most operational pressure?
- Where are the geographic hotspots for 12-hour breaches?

---

## Testing

This project has been tested under normal operating conditions ("happy path")
- ETL pipeline runs end-to-end without errors
- SQL queries return the expected results
- Streamlit dashboard loads all pages and visuals

---

## Reflections & Takeaways

- Refactored Streamlit into a modular, multi-page app
- Debugged SQL query paths and ensured robust data loading
- Designed visuals that are both informative and intuitive
- Learned to balance technical depth with user experience

---

## Future Development & Deployment

### Performance Optimisation
- Index key columns (`period`, `org_code`)
- Pre-aggregate metrics in staging tables
- Use views for repeated logic

### Error Handling & Logging
- Add try/except blocks around SQL execution
- Log failed queries or empty datasets
- Use Streamlit‚Äôs `st.warning()` and `st.error()` for user feedback

### Security & Privacy
- No patient-level data used
- Trust-level metrics only
- DB access restricted via credentials and roles

### Cloud Deployment (AWS)
- **S3**: Store raw and transformed data
- **RDS**: Host PostgreSQL database
- **Lambda**: Automate ETL jobs
- **CloudWatch**: Monitor logs and alerts
- **EC2 or Streamlit Cloud**: Host dashboard
