# üè• NHS A&E Data Pipeline & Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview

This project builds a modular data engineering pipeline to extract, transform, and load publicly available NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) datasets into a SQL database. The goal is to surface meaningful operational insights through interactive visualizations using Streamlit ‚Äî helping NHS analysts, clinicians, and managers make data-driven decisions.

## Data Journey: ETL Pipeline

### üîπ Extract
- Raw CSVs downloaded from [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/)
- Monthly trust-level data on attendances, breaches, 12-hour waits, and emergency admissions

### üîπ Transform
- Cleaned and filtered using pandas
- Removed rows with zero attendances or missing coordinates
- Converted `period` to datetime format
- Enriched with latitude/longitude for geospatial mapping
- Aggregated breach metrics and standardized trust codes

### üîπ Load
- Loaded into a PostgreSQL database (Pagila schema)
- Queried via modular SQL scripts for performance and maintainability

### üîπ Visualize
- Streamlit dashboard with multi-page layout:
  - National trends
  - Trust-level breach analysis
  - Geospatial pressure hotspots

---

## Dashboard Features

### Home Page
- National % seen within 4 hours over time
- Top 5 trusts with highest 12-hour waits
- Metric cards and line charts for quick insights

### Operational Pressure
- KPI breakdowns by present month (July 2025)
- Breach rate analysis and emergency admission trends

### Geospatial Mapping
- Interactive map showing trust-level pressure hotspots
- Sized and colored by 12-hour waits
- Hover reveals trust name and attendance volume

---

## Key Questions & Insights

- How has A&E performance changed over time?
- Which trusts are under the most operational pressure?
- Where are the geographic hotspots for 12-hour breaches?
- How do attendances correlate with breach rates and admissions?

## Testing

This project has been tested under normal operating conditions ("happy path")
- ETL pipeline runs end to end without errors
- SQL queries return the expected results
- Streamlit dashboard loads all pages and visuals
- Data types behave as they should

## Reflections & Takeaways

- Refactored Streamlit into a modular, multi-page app
- Debugged SQL query paths and ensured robust data loading
- Designed visuals that are both informative and intuitive
- Learned to balance technical depth with user experience

---

## Future Development & Deployment

### Performance Optimization
- Index key columns (`period`, `org_code`)
- Pre-aggregate metrics in staging tables
- Use views for repeated logic

### Error Handling & Logging
- Add try/except blocks around SQL execution
- Log failed queries or empty datasets
- Use Streamlit‚Äôs `st.warning()` and `st.error()` for user feedback

### Security & Privacy
- No patient-level data used
- Trust-level metrics only
- DB access restricted via credentials and roles

### Cloud Deployment (AWS)
- **S3**: Store raw and transformed data
- **RDS**: Host PostgreSQL database
- **Lambda**: Automate ETL jobs
- **CloudWatch**: Monitor logs and alerts
- **EC2 or Streamlit Cloud**: Host dashboard
